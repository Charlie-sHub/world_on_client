# World On

Front end of the World On project.

## Work flow to collaborate on the project

1. Fetch develop (should always be up to date with master)
2. Branch from develop with a name following this pattern [Initials]/[PBI-number]-[PBI name], for example: "CM/WOP-1-some-feature"
3. Work on that branch making commits and merges as necessary
4. Create Pull Request to develop when done, merging with it right before
5. From develop a dev build* will be created to test the added feature/fix
6. Merge with main if everything goes correctly
7. Rinse and repeat

*The workflows and actions for that haven't been created yet, neither a development backend, builds will have to be created and distributed manually for now
